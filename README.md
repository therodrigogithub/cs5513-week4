Description
Our fifth assignment continues our exploration of the Next.js development framework. This assignment asks you to create a new Next.js-powered application from scratch, built with Bootstrap 5.x styles, using the create-next-app node package.

Requirements
Build a Next.js-powered full-stack application that reads data from at least two separate JSON files. Your app must use data fetching and pre-rendered static page generation to display a list of people by name on the home page. Use dynamic page routing to create a page component to display complete details about individual persons that retrieves data from at least two JSON files to render links to other related persons. Use a Replit.com workspace, or your own local environment, to host your creation. Manage your application's code using a GitHub repository and git from your workspace shell's command-line interface. 

Purpose
Continue writing server-side JavaScript code for the Node.js runtime.
Explore the creation of a full-stack application from scratch that utilizes more than one JSON file.
